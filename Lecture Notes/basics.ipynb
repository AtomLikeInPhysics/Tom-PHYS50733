    "\n",

There are two types of arugments: arguments (often abbreviated \"args\" in documentation) and keyword arguments (abbreivated \"kwargs\"). Arguments are passed in order and close attention must be paid to ensure you pass args in the order the function expects. Keyword arguments are specified explicitly, and can be passed in any order. There are no strict rules for passing args vs kwargs, but it is more \"pythonic\" to use a minimum number of args and use explicit kwargs for as many arguments as make sense.\n",

This makes them good for flags, or for arguments that _usually_ one value, but you ocassionally want to change it. kwargs can also be passed in order, after args. But again: explicit is better than implicit. Also for this reason, args must be specified first in the function definition, and the function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final style note, a more \"pythonic\" approach to functions is to keep them simple. A function can be as complicated as you like, but it is generally best practice to keep them simple. Functions can call other functions, allowing you to compartmentalize complexity.\n",

This tends to be what we use most of the time because we tend to want to loop over some input list.\n",

For example, we will see in many cases in this course we need to run a process until a certain precision is reached. This can't be done with `for` loops. But `while` loops can also be dangerous!

Nevertheless, I want you to be aware of it, if for no other reason than it might pop up in my code.\n",

Anytime you call `plt`, an \"axis\" object is created, and that object is modified by further `plt` commands until you start a new cell, or create a new figure explicitly. Generally, while working in notebooks, this behavior is fine, and completely under-the-hood. Although you will occasionally notice when you're doing something more complex, you have to call `plt.gca()` (\"get current axis\"), which allows you to directly access the implicit axis object.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also work with axes objectes directly, and in fact if you ever make multi-panel plots, you will **have to** do so. For most, perhaps all, of this course, you can probably use either method. Let's show that they are interchangeable"

For example some public data is released with very large negative numbers indicating bad values, so you might check where a data column is positive, `data[\"column\"] > 0`. There is an assumption here that `data[\"column\"]` is an array; if it was not this operation would probably throw an error. This results in another array the same length as `data[\"column\"]` now consisting of boolean values, either `True` where the condition is satisfied, or `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subset of a `numpy` array can be selected directly with that boolean array. It is also common to use the `np.where` method to select the indices where an array is `True`. This is effectively equivalent if you are only subsetting one array, but in cases where you need to know which indices satisfy your condition. For applications with large arrays (> 10000 elements), you can speed up the code dramatically if you figure out indices once and specificy indices in your loops, as compared to dictionaries or doing some kind of \"subsetting\" repeatedly."
